	<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards</p>

	<h3>Why should you play?</h3>
		<p>I love steak, medium rare. Rib eye preferred, pan seared for 30 sec on high heat on cast iron with garlic cloves, rose-marry, and thyme mixed with table spoon of unsalted butter topped with lava salt, flip for another 30 sec and rest it in a Yeti.</p>
